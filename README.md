SNHU CS-230 Assignment 8-2 Journal

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements?
The client Gaming Room are game developers that have developed a android game "Draw it or lose it"
They want to expand this game onto a web-based application of their game.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The design was to capture all the features and functionailities of the game onto web-based applications.
The design had comparisons of the different operating platforms and important considerations 
based on the technical requirements and needs of the client. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
When desigining this document I believe I did the camparisons of the 4 operating platforms well.
I highlighted the numerous strengths and weaknesses that each platform brought to the table well.
The insight was concise and I summarized the information whilst giving some insight to more of the specifics.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of just tailoring down needs and objectives was incredibly helpful for developing code.
By pointing out what functions are needed, the potential constraints and the best way to proceed with coding
gave a clear path and direction to the project which is incredibly useful when coding.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise?
I believe I would revise the Distributed system and networks section under recommendations.
I feel that I still have much to learn and I can give better indight or better recommendations regarding
the topic.

How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and implement them into your software design?
I interpretted the users need as trying to play the game in its closest feeling and functionality to the
original android game as possible. The user interrpretation was also to play the game in the most simpliest
and easiest way possible without having worries about secutity or performance/ requirement issues.
Its crucial to consider the users need as that is the consumer of the product. Its critical for the 
business and not only that critcal for the user as well. If its poorly made you can be responsible for 
performance, security and features.

How did you approach designing software?
The approach I used was keeping the clients needs and objectives at the forefront. So whenever I would 
create a design, recommendation or comparison it was revolving around what the client wanted and their 
goals. I believe this is a very effective approach that I can utilie in the future
